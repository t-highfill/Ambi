# Ambi
Ambi is a Java Swing based GUI application for reading e-books while listening to a curated soundtrack.
Books are stored as zip files containing the pages of the book, the music, and a JSON metadata file.
Ambi reads these files and presents the book to the user while playing the appropriate music.

I created this for a class, but I'd had the idea for a while. It comes from my habit of listening to music while I read.
I wanted a way to have  kind of "soundtrack" to my books that would change along with the text/pictures like the soundtrack in a movie or TV show.
